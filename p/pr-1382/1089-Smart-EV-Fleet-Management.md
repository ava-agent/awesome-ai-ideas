## Problem Background & User Pain Points

### The EV Fleet Management Crisis
With the global transition to electric vehicles accelerating, fleet operators face unprecedented challenges in optimizing EV operations. Traditional fleet management systems designed for internal combustion engines are ill-equipped to handle the unique constraints of electric vehicles - limited range, charging time requirements, and complex energy management needs. This creates a critical productivity gap that's costing businesses millions in operational inefficiency.

### Core User Pain Points
- **Range Anxiety**: 68% of fleet managers cite range limitations as their biggest concern
- **Charging Bottlenecks**: Optimizing charging schedules and locations is complex and time-consuming
- **Energy Cost Volatility**: Electricity prices vary significantly by time and location, creating cost uncertainty
- **Operational Inefficiency**: Traditional routing algorithms don't account for EV-specific constraints
- **Battery Management**: Proactive battery health monitoring is essential but challenging at scale
- **Environmental Pressure**: 79% of companies face stakeholder pressure to reduce carbon footprint

### The Economic Impact
- **Lost Productivity**: Inefficient EV routing costs companies 15-25% in lost delivery capacity
- **Energy Waste**: Poor charging optimization results in 30-40% higher energy costs
- **Maintenance Costs**: Poor battery management increases battery replacement costs by 45%
- **Regulatory Compliance**: 60% of fleet operators struggle with evolving EV regulations
- **Competitive Disadvantage**: Companies without optimized EV operations lose market share to competitors
